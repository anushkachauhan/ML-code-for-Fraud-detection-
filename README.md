# ML-code-for-Fraud-detection-

Won the Dell Hack to Hire Hackathon.

I had used K means Clustering algorithm, K Nearest Neighbor, Isolation Forest methods to detect the fraud.
The best suited Algorithm is KNN.
Found this by using the confusion metrix. Currently Working upon it to make it better.

Got the Dataset from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
